#Development environment
I downloaded the windows 10 iso file, made a bootable file with rufus and flushed it to the laptop following each step as required.

#Visual studio code
I downloaded and installed the visual studio code and installed some extensions to the program such as github and python extension.

#git install
I had a git profile before configured. I installed git for desktop and configured it for the project.

#python installation
I installed python and correctly set up the path in the environment variables.

#pip install
I installed the pip manager by downloading the get-pip.py file then running the following cURL command in the command prompt:
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py then later installed it with the command python get-pip.py

#mysql workbent installation
I downloaded and installed mysql workbench and configured the database

#virtual environment install
I set up the virtual environment for the python projects with
pip install virtual env

In this installation, I managed to perform some configurations in themeing and extensions

In the set up I didnt face much challenges though except some little difficulties in the virtual environment set up
